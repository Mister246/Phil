# Phil

Phil is a random audio player. He plays random audio files from a specific folder at random intervals of time. 

Place all mp3s and wavs in Phil_Data > Resources > Audio Files

The reload sounds button can be used to add audio to the Audio Files folder without needing to restart Phil.

The only two stable audio formats I've tested are wavs and mp3s, Phil should work fine with both.

audioState.txt in the Resources folder dynamically updates with the name of the audio file being played.
